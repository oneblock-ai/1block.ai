It will not only reshape how we live, work, and play but also revolutionize how we develop software.\\nWe are building **1Block.AI** to assist both developers and non-developers in unlocking the power of LLMs, allowing them to construct their own generative AI applications using a single, unified management platform.\\n\\n### What is 1Block.AI\\n\\n**1Block.AI** is an open-source, cloud-native LLMOps platform that fosters innovation in LLMs and generative AI applications. It is built on top of cutting-edge technologies such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Ray.io](https://ray.io/), [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction), etc., and designed to be cloud-agnostic and ML framework agnostic.\\n\\nProjects like Ray(also KubeRay), and LangChain are excellent open-source projects for ML lifecycle management and can be served as the core components of the LLMOps. For instance, Ray offers powerful distributed computing capabilities and a comprehensive ML computing framework, forming a powerful ML foundation for the platform. However, they lack a unified solution for multi-cluster management, multi-tenancy, cost control, data privacy protection, resource versioning, etc. \\nThese aspects need addressing in other components of the LLMOps platform. In essence, we believe a user-friendly LLMOps platform should encompass:\\n\\n- **Cost-effectiveness and Data Privacy**: The platform must be open-source, feature a distributed architecture, and support private deployment.\\n- **Easy to Use**: Provide a unified interface for developers and non-developers to implement complete life cycle management of Large Language Models(LLM) and generative AI applications.\\n    - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Iteratively explore, share, and prepare data for the machine learning lifecycle by creating reproducible, editable, and shareable datasets, tables, and visual charts.\\n    - **Model Registration and Management**: Allow users to upload, track, and manage versions of models and associate them with specific datasets and hyperparameters.\\n    - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Ensure the continuous updating and deployment of models and AI agents, enabling them to respond promptly to new data and changes.\\n    - **Performance Monitoring and Logging**: Real-time monitoring of model performance, including metrics such as inference time, memory usage, and logging all interactions for auditing and fine-tuning.\\n    - **Automated Tuning and Optimization**: Automatically adjust and optimize models using tools to maintain their optimal performance in different environments.\\n- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Compatible with different cloud infrastructures and different ML frameworks(cloud-agnostic & ML-agnostic).\\n- **Scalability and Portability**: Supports serverless deployment, provides a unified solution for LLMs and generative AI applications to be deployed anywhere, from public cloud to on-premise servers.\\n- **Interoperability and maintainability**: customizable and extendable with cloud-native and ML ecosystems.\\n\\n![1block-ai-architecture](./2023-11-28-hello-world/1block-ai-architecture.png)\\n\\n## Join Us\\nWe are excited to build a community around the project.

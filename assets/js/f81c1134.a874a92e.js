Bootstrap and Installation Support\\n\\nSetting up LLMOS has been simplified through easy-to-use **[installation script](https://llmos.1block.ai/docs/installation/)** and comprehensive **[bootstrap configurations](https://llmos.1block.ai/docs/installation/configurations)**, making it easy for users to get up and running.\\n\\n### 10. Easy Upgrades\\n\\nWith streamlined upgrade capabilities, LLMOS ensures that you can quickly adopt new features and improvements with minimal disruption.\\n\\n## LLMOS Use Cases\\n\\n- **AI Research & Development:** Simplify the management of LLMs and AI infrastructure, allowing researchers to focus on innovation rather than operational overhead.\\n- **Enterprise AI Solutions:** Streamline the deployment of AI applications with scalable infrastructure, making it easier to manage models, storage, and resources across multiple teams.\\n- **Data Science Workflows:** With notebook integration and powerful cluster computing, LLMOS is ideal for data scientists looking to run complex experiments at scale.\\n- **AI-Driven Products:** From chatbots to automated content generation, LLMOS simplifies the process of deploying LLM-based products that can serve millions of users and scale up horizontally.\\n\\n## Getting Started with LLMOS\\n\\nReady to get started with **LLMOS**? Our [detailed documentation](https://llmos.1block.ai/docs/) covers everything from installation to advanced features. Whether you\u2019re a developer, data scientist, or system administrator, you\u2019ll find LLMOS easy to set up and use, below is the quick-start guideline.\\n\\n:::note\\n  Make sure your nodes meet the [requirements](https://llmos.1block.ai/docs/installation/requirements) before proceeding.\\n:::\\n\\n##### Installation Script\\n\\nLLMOS can be installed to a bare-metal server or a virtual machine. To bootstrap a **new cluster**, follow the steps below:\\n```bash\\ncurl -sfL https://get-llmos.1block.ai | sh -s - --cluster-init --token mytoken\\n```\\n\\nTo monitor installation logs, run `journalctl -u llmos -f`.\\n\\nIf your environment requires internet access through a proxy, set the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables before running the installation script:\\n```bash\\nexport HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080\\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080\\nexport NO_PROXY=127.0.0.0/8,10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16 # Replace the CIDRs with your own\\n```\\n\\n##### Getting Started\\n\\nAfter installing LLMOS, access the dashboard by navigating to `https://<server-ip>:8443` in your web browser.\\n\\n1. LLMOS will create a default `admin` user with a randomly generated password. To retrieve the password, run the following command on the **cluster-init** node:\\n\\n   ```shell\\n   kubectl get secret --namespace llmos-system llmos-bootstrap-passwd -o go-template=\'{{.data.password|base64decode}}{{\\"\\\\n\\"}}\'\\n   ```\\n    ![welcome-login](introduce-llmos/welcome-login.png)\\n1. Upon logging in, you will be redirected to the setup page. Configure the following:\\n  - Set a **new password** for the admin user (strong passwords are recommended).\\n  - Configure the **server URL** that all other nodes in your cluster will use to connect.\\n![welcome-config](introduce-llmos/welcome-config.png)\\n1. After setup, you will be redirected to the home page where you can start using LLMOS.\\n![home-page](introduce-llmos/home-page.png)\\n\\n## More Examples\\n\\nTo learn more about using LLMOS, explore the following resources:\\n\\n- [Chat with LLMOS Models](https://llmos.1block.ai/docs/user_guide/llm_management/serve)\\n- [Creating a Jupyter Notebook](https://llmos.1block.ai/docs/user_guide/llm_management/notebooks#create-a-notebook)\\n- [Creating a Machine Learning Cluster](https://llmos.1block.ai/docs/user_guide/ml_clusters)\\n\\n## Join Us\\n\\nWe are excited to build a community around the project.

It will not only reshape how we live, work, and play but also revolutionize how we develop software.\\nWe are building **1Block.AI** to assist both developers and non-developers in unlocking the power of LLMs, allowing them to construct their own generative AI applications using a single, unified management platform.\\n\\n### What is 1Block.AI\\n\\n**1Block.AI** is an open-source, cloud-native LLMOps platform that fosters innovation in LLMs and generative AI applications. It is built on top of cutting-edge technologies such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Ray.io](https://ray.io/), [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/index.html), etc., and designed to be cloud-agnostic and ML framework agnostic.\\n\\nProjects like Ray(also KubeRay), and LangChain are excellent open-source projects for ML lifecycle management and can be served as the core components of the LLMOps. For instance, Ray offers powerful distributed computing capabilities and a comprehensive ML computing framework, forming a powerful ML foundation for the platform. However, they lack a unified solution for cluster management, multi-tenancy, cost control, data privacy protection, resource versioning, etc. \\nThese aspects need addressing in other components of the LLMOps platform. In essence, we believe a user-friendly LLMOps platform should encompass:\\n\\n- **Cost-effectiveness and Data Privacy**: The platform must be open-source, feature a distributed architecture, and support private deployment.\\n- **Easy to Use**: Provide a unified interface for developers and non-developers to implement complete life cycle management of Large Language Models(LLM) and generative AI applications.\\n    - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Iteratively explore, share, and prepare data for the machine learning lifecycle by creating reproducible, editable, and shareable datasets, tables, and visual charts.\\n    - **Model Registration and Management**: Allow users to upload, track, and manage versions of models and associate them with specific datasets and hyperparameters.\\n    - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Ensure the continuous updating and deployment of models and AI agents, enabling them to respond promptly to new data and changes.\\n    - **Performance Monitoring and Logging**: Real-time monitoring of model performance, including metrics such as inference time, memory usage, and logging all interactions for auditing and fine-tuning.\\n    - **Automated Tuning and Optimization**: Automatically adjust and optimize models using tools to maintain their optimal performance in different environments.\\n- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Compatible with different cloud infrastructures and different ML frameworks(cloud-agnostic & ML-agnostic).\\n- **Scalability and Portability**: Supports serverless deployment, provides a unified solution for LLMs and generative AI applications to be deployed anywhere, from public cloud to on-premise servers.\\n- **Interoperability and maintainability**: customizable and extendable with cloud-native and ML ecosystems.\\n\\n![1block-ai-architecture](hello-world/1block-ai-architecture.png)\\n\\n## Join Us\\nWe are excited to build a community around the project.
